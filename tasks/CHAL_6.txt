Round 6

Create a page based on the design found in design folder in the dog-page. There are 2 photos, header and content. You should implement the page
with both elements (from header and content).

Use dog-page/index.html for all HTML related code and dog-page/css/styles.css file for all CSS related code.

Inside dog-page/images you have access to all related images.

Observations:
  - Add a title to the HTML page;
  - All the dependencies have been added so no need to import anything;
  - Use bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/);
  - Use font awesome for icons (https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery);
